# CrossFit Athletes Performance Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes a dataset of **CrossFit athletes** collected from competitions and training profiles worldwide.  
The goal is to understand athlete characteristics (age, gender, body size, background, training habits) and link them to performance metrics (strength lifts, benchmark workouts).

## Dataset
Source: [CrossFit Athletes Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ulrikthygepedersen/crossfit-athletes?select=athletes.csv)  

- Includes age, gender, height, weight, training background.  
- Records of benchmark workouts (Fran, Grace, Helen, Filthy50, etc.) and lifts (deadlift, squat, snatch, C&J).  

Dataset is too large for GitHub â†’ download from Kaggle and place in `/data`.

## Progress So Far
- âœ… Set up project structure  
- âœ… Data inspection (shape, columns, dtypes)  
- âœ… Data consistency check (missingness, min/max values)  
- ðŸ”œ Define cleaning rules  
- ðŸ”œ Perform EDA  
- ðŸ”œ Build predictive models  

---

## Next Steps
- Clean dataset (remove unrealistic values, handle missing values).  
- Explore correlations between demographics, habits, and performance.  
- Train regression models to predict **deadlift** and **back squat**.  
- Evaluate model accuracy and feature importance.
